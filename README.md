 ## Installation Instructions:
 This project does not require user installation, as the functionality of the website mostly works through calls to our hosted server.

 ## Usage Instructions:
 To use the PokeTeam Manager, the user will first be brought to a page with a list of teams that have already been added to our database. Upon loading this page, the user will see a list of tables with team names assigned to them, along with a navbar with various options. The teams are organized into a series of tables which feature buttons to edit a team, add a pokemon, or edit pokemon. Upon adding a team, it will initially be empty, so the user can select the add pokemon button to add pokemon first to the database of stored pokemon on the site,using a call to the PokeAPI, and then from that database, they can then add a selected pokemon to a specific team, using the Add Pokemon to Team button located on the view all Pokemon page.
